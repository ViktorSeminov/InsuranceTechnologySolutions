Test code

For a Task which described below we making a few assumptions.
Because word "Layer" present at task description, we choose layered infrastructure for our app.
Adding only example of exceptions for our app, in real applications there should be more of them for Infra and App levels.
Documentation also not full and shown only for example.
Error handling not full.
Not using DTO's and Repositories because it's simple example, and to avoid overengineering.
All parts done locally without Azure Infrastructure. If needed, can be done later.
All upper parts are time consuming, and added at app only for example.



Programming Task
Complete the backend for a multi-tier application for Insurance Claims Handling. The use case is to maintain a list of insurance claims. The user should be able to create, delete and read claims.

Task 1
The codebase is messy:

The controller has too much responsibility.
Introduce proper layering within the codebase.
Documentation is missing.
++
Adhere to the SOLID principles.

Task 2
As you can see, the API supports some basic REST operations. But validation is missing. The basic rules are:

Claim
DamageCost cannot exceed 100.000
Created date must be within the period of the related Cover
Cover
StartDate cannot be in the past
total insurance period cannot exceed 1 year
Task 3
Auditing. The basics are there, but the execution of the DB command (INSERT & DELETE) blocks the processing of the HTTP request. How can this be improved? Look into some asynchronous patterns. It is ok to introduce an Azure managed service to help you with this (ServiceBus/EventGrid/Whatever), but that is not required. Whatever you can manage to get working which is in-memory is also ok.

Task 4
One basic test is included, please add other (mandatory) unit tests. Note: If you start on this task first, you will find it hard to write proper tests. Some refactoring of the Claims API will be needed.

Task 5
Cover premium computation formula evolved over time. Fellow developers were lazy and omitted all tests. Now there are a couple of bugs. Can you fix them? Can you make the computation more readable?

Desired logic:

Premium depends on the type of the covered object and the length of the insurance period.
Base day rate was set to be 1250.
Yacht should be 10% more expensive, Passenger ship 20%, Tanker 50%, and other types 30%
The length of the insurance period should influence the premium progressively:
First 30 days are computed based on the logic above
Following 150 days are discounted by 5% for Yacht and by 2% for other types
The remaining days are discounted by additional 3% for Yacht and by 1% for other types
